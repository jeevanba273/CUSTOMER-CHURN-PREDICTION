Customer Churn Prediction
Project Overview
This project involves analyzing customer data to predict churn behavior for a telecom company. The primary goal is to develop predictive models that can identify customers at risk of leaving, thereby enabling targeted retention strategies.

Dataset
The project utilizes the "WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn" dataset, which contains customer information with the following features:

Services: Phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, streaming TV, and movies.
Account Information: Duration as a customer, contract type, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges.
Demographics: Gender, age range, and presence of partners and dependents.
Target Variable: Churn (indicating whether a customer has left within the last month).
Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook
Data Analysis: Microsoft Excel
Files
Dataset: WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv
Jupyter Notebook: Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb
Excel File: Data_Exploration.xlsx
Implementation
Data Exploration: Analyzed the dataset to understand customer attributes and the distribution of the target variable.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the data for modeling, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Model Building: Implemented various machine learning models to predict customer churn, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.
Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Results
The project demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in predicting customer churn. The models provided insights into the factors contributing to customer attrition and suggested strategies for improving retention.
